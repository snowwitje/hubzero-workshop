This repository contains slides from our team's most recent public demos and talks.

### MozFest 2016 ###
We are excited to be taking part in MozFest 2016! Last year we led a discussion session on UX Design Challenges in Scientific Software. This time we'll host 3 sessions in the Open Science space on developing and sharing scientific simulation tools and online collaboration. Looking forward to meeting you in London!

## What's HUBzero?

HUBzero® is an open source software platform for building powerful Web sites that support scientific discovery, learning, and collaboration. Some refer to such web sites as "collaboratories" supporting "team science." We call them "hubs" because each site becomes a focal point for its user community.

Originally created by researchers at Purdue University in conjunction with the NSF-sponsored Network for Computational Nanotechnology to support nanoHUB.org, the HUBzero platform now supports dozens of hubs across a variety of disciplines, including cancer research, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, microelectromechanical systems, climate modeling, water quality, volcanology, and more.
