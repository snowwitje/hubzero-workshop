# The HUBzero® Platform for Scientific Collaboration
This repository contains materials and slides from our team's most recent public demos, hackathons and workshops.

## What's HUBzero?

HUBzero® is an open source software platform for building powerful Web sites that support scientific discovery, learning, and collaboration. Some refer to such web sites as "collaboratories" supporting "team science." We call them "hubs" because each site becomes a focal point for its user community.

Originally created by researchers at Purdue University in conjunction with the NSF-sponsored Network for Computational Nanotechnology to support nanoHUB.org, the HUBzero platform now supports dozens of hubs across a variety of disciplines, including cancer research, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, microelectromechanical systems, climate modeling, water quality, volcanology, and more.
